<p>You can understand and analyaze the importance of computer by seeing a revolution in offline & online communication ,& internet banking.To store ,access, 
manipulate,calculate,analyze data & information we use hardware devices & software applications.All our daily life activites are based on such online services &products .The computer changed our life 2 decades ago now it is a necessity to use a computer in a daily life to live.</p>

<p>School and college around the world are using computer software and web technologies to teach students digitally & creatively with data visualisation.Uses of the computer in a classroom will explore creatively & imagination in the students mind.Drawing  tools,spreedsheets,Audio, video lectures & ppt ,etc. Are very beneficial for students to learn more deeply & accuretely.That created the new education bussiness model known as smart classes, smart  classrooms & digital classrooms.Any students can take benefit of the internet & computer after having basic computer skills.</p>


<p> As you know the education is the most important in our  life. Computer reinvented the education systems.Schools,colleges,& almost all kinds of educational institutions  are  using a computer in the classrooms.There are so many colleges and universties that are now providing online degree programs for college  students.Computer are most important  educational tools for teachers & learners .YouTube ,Blogs, eBooks,News paper,E-News paper etc.Such Educational tools are not possible without a computer that we're using today.</p>

<p> You can learn almost all types of technical& non-technical skills online with the use of a computer.There are so many online courses platforms where you can learn & improve skills for job,carer,& bussiness development.So,become educated ,skillful we can use computers & this is one of the most beneficial uses of the computer in our daily life.Now as you can see that you can do  and learn any type of skills online just by using the computer from your home.Now it's the use of computers.But it's not just for learners.</p>

<p>To create these courses,to launch  & promote educational materials &  even you're reading this post in all of this  & more is not possible without a computer,a network of computers,servers,Internet protocols,graphics,website,domains & espcially the creator.It's looking very easy to search on Google to find any type of informaton.But behind that easiness , there are lots of computer technologies ,efforts ,hardwork,& human power.
That's the use of computer in education . And  that's why I recommend everyone to learn basic computer  skills.</p>
