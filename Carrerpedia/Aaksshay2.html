    <h1> Machine Learning </h1>
    <p> Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical<br> model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p>
    <h2> What is Ensemble Methods  </h2>
    <p> Ensemble methods is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model</p>

<p>A Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm that is particularly well-suited for image recognition and processing tasks. It is made up of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.</p>
<p> The convocational layers are the key component of a CNN, where filters are applied to the input image to extract features such as edges, textures, and shapes. The output of the convolutional layers is then passed through pooling layers, which are used to down-sample the feature maps, reducing the spatial dimensions while retaining the most important information. The output of the pooling layers is then passed through one or more fully connected layers, which are used to make a prediction or classify the image.</p>
